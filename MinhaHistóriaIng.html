        <i>MY STORY</i>
         <p>This small bibiography's main objective is to show my entire journey to where I have come and important traits of my personality. <br>

             I think my entire professional career started in 8th grade, when I was just 13 years old. I always really liked how games and applications worked and I always had an internal desire to develop them as well. <br>
             The following year I started looking for technical courses in the development area and as soon as I heard about ETESP I couldn't waste time and immediately asked my father to enroll me in a course so I could enter that famous school. <br>
             While I was in high school I discovered several important languages that will be mentioned in the “knowledge” part. <br>
             Furthermore, I also signed up for a gaming school, “Zion”, in my first year of high school, which gave me a much greater experience than I would have had if I hadn't signed up.</p>
