        <i>MY GOALS</i>
        <p>This humble text aims to quickly demonstrate my deepest ambitions that carry me day after day. <br>

            I have always been a big dreamer who has never been able to give up on my goals. To this day I still remember the deepest dreams I had as a child.
           
            Of course, nowadays I am a much more realistic person than when I was a child and so, without further ado I will mention my main dreams. <br>
           
            1- Being rich: Of course, the main dream of someone like me is to be rich, that is, to try hard enough to be worthy of a great salary <br>
           
            2- Participate in something big: I always wanted to be part of something big that many people could enjoy, even if I don't receive as much recognition as the other members. <br>
           
            3- Helping a lot of people: last but not least, I always liked helping a lot of people, regardless of whether they know who is helping them.</p>
